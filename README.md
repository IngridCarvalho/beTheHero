# Be The Hero!

Project developed at RocketSeat's OmniStack Week.

A web and mobile application was developed, using ReactJS, React Native and NodeJS.

The application consists of connecting ONGs with people who can collaborate with donations in the registered cases, thus becoming heroes of these cases.
